# Healthcare Domain & HIPAA Compliance Guidelines

## HIPAA Compliance & Data Privacy

- **CRITICAL**: Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling for all Patient Health Information (PHI)
- Use field-level encryption for sensitive patient data in database and transmission
- Implement proper de-identification techniques for analytics and reporting
- Use secure audit trails for all PHI access with user identification, timestamps, and actions
- Implement automatic session timeouts and secure logout procedures
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) with minimum necessary principle
- Implement proper data retention and deletion policies according to healthcare regulations

## Patient Data Security Architecture

- Store PHI with AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit
- Use separate database schemas for PHI vs. non-PHI data
- Implement database-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Use tokenization for patient identifiers in non-secure environments
- Implement proper key management and rotation policies
- Use secure backup procedures with encrypted storage
- Implement geo-redundancy for disaster recovery compliance

## Healthcare Authentication & Authorization

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for healthcare providers
- Use strong password policies (minimum 12 characters, complexity requirements)
- Implement account lockout policies after failed login attempts
- Use session management with secure cookies and proper timeout handling
- Reference authentication patterns from [lib/auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts) and [lib/serverAuth.ts](mdc:lib/serverAuth.ts)
- Implement proper user provisioning and de-provisioning workflows
- Use certificate-based authentication for system-to-system communication

## Medical Data Models & Validation

- Follow HL7 FHIR standards for healthcare data interoperability where applicable
- Implement proper validation for medical codes (ICD-10, CPT, NDC, LOINC)
- Use standardized date/time formats for medical records (ISO 8601)
- Implement proper validation for medical measurements and units
- Use proper data models for patient demographics with cultural sensitivity
- Reference healthcare data patterns in [lib/interface.ts](mdc:lib/interface.ts)
- Implement proper allergy and medication interaction checking

## Appointment Management System

- Use the scheduling configuration from [lib/config.ts](mdc:lib/config.ts) TIMINGS object
- Implement proper appointment conflict detection and resolution
- Use timezone-aware scheduling for multi-location practices
- Implement appointment reminder systems with patient preferences
- Use proper cancellation and rescheduling workflows
- Implement waitlist management for cancelled appointments
- Follow patterns in [components/client/appointments/](mdc:components/client/appointments/)

## Healthcare Provider Management

- Implement proper credential verification for healthcare providers
- Use license validation and expiration tracking
- Implement proper specialty and procedure authorization
- Use availability management with complex scheduling rules
- Implement proper provider-patient relationship management
- Reference patterns in [components/dashboard/doctors/](mdc:components/dashboard/doctors/)
- Use proper delegation and coverage workflows

## Medical Records & Documentation

- Implement proper medical record versioning and change tracking
- Use digital signature capabilities for healthcare providers
- Implement proper clinical note templates and structured data entry
- Use proper medication reconciliation workflows
- Implement proper laboratory and imaging result integration
- Use proper discharge summary and care plan generation
- Implement proper medical history and family history tracking

## Healthcare Communication & Notifications

- Use secure messaging systems for patient-provider communication
- Implement proper consent management for communication preferences
- Use encrypted email for PHI transmission with proper disclaimers
- Implement appointment reminder systems with multiple channels (SMS, email, calls)
- Use proper emergency contact and notification workflows
- Reference email patterns in [utils/email-template/](mdc:utils/email-template/)
- Implement proper patient portal notifications

## Clinical Decision Support

- Implement drug interaction checking with comprehensive databases
- Use allergy alert systems with severity classifications
- Implement proper clinical guideline integration
- Use evidence-based medicine alerts and recommendations
- Implement proper risk assessment and scoring systems
- Use clinical pathway management for standardized care
- Implement proper quality measure tracking and reporting

## Healthcare Analytics & Reporting

- Implement HIPAA-compliant analytics with proper de-identification
- Use population health metrics and tracking
- Implement proper clinical outcome measurements
- Use quality reporting for regulatory compliance (CMS, HEDIS)
- Implement proper financial analytics for healthcare operations
- Use proper dashboard design for clinical and operational metrics
- Implement proper benchmarking against industry standards

## Regulatory Compliance & Audit

- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all PHI access and modifications
- Use proper incident response procedures for security breaches
- Implement regular security risk assessments and vulnerability testing
- Use proper business associate agreements (BAAs) for third-party services
- Implement proper staff training and awareness programs
- Use proper policies and procedures documentation
- Implement regular compliance monitoring and reporting
