# TypeScript Healthcare Coding Standards

## Healthcare-Specific TypeScript Guidelines

- Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://mkosir.github.io/typescript-style-guide/#naming) with healthcare domain adaptations
- Use TSDoc comments for all healthcare APIs, medical business logic, and compliance-critical code
- Use strict TypeScript configuration from [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json) with healthcare-appropriate compiler options
- Use path aliases `@/*` for internal healthcare modules to improve code organization
- **CRITICAL**: Implement proper type safety for Patient Health Information (PHI) handling

## Healthcare Domain Naming Conventions

- **Components**: Use PascalCase with healthcare context (`PatientCard`, `AppointmentScheduler`, `MedicalRecordForm`)
- **Interfaces**: Use PascalCase with healthcare domain prefixes (`IPatientData`, `IAppointmentRequest`, `IMedicalRecord`)
- **Types**: Use PascalCase for medical domain types (`AppointmentStatus`, `PatientGender`, `MedicalSpecialty`)
- **Variables**: Use camelCase with descriptive healthcare terms (`patientId`, `appointmentDateTime`, `medicalHistory`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase with action-oriented healthcare naming (`scheduleAppointment`, `updatePatientRecord`, `validateMedicalData`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for healthcare configurations (`APPOINTMENT_DURATION_MINUTES`, `MAX_DAILY_APPOINTMENTS`)
- **Files**: Use kebab-case for healthcare domain files (`patient-management.ts`, `appointment-scheduler.tsx`)

## Healthcare Type Safety & PHI Protection

- **Never use `any` type** - especially critical for healthcare data handling
- Use `unknown` for external healthcare data before validation
- Prefer interfaces over types for healthcare data structures
- Use union types for medical enums (`'scheduled' | 'confirmed' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'`)
- Use optional properties (`?`) for non-required medical fields
- Implement branded types for sensitive identifiers (SSN, patient IDs, medical record numbers)
- Use proper generic constraints for healthcare data operations

## Healthcare Import/Export Patterns

- **Import Organization**: Group imports in healthcare-appropriate order:
  1. React/Next.js framework imports
  2. Healthcare-specific third-party libraries (HL7, medical validators)
  3. Internal healthcare modules (`@/lib/medical`, `@/services/patient`)
  4. Relative healthcare component imports
- Use named exports for healthcare utilities, components, and services
- Use default exports sparingly - only for pages, layouts, and main healthcare modules
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for all internal healthcare modules
- Reference healthcare configurations from [lib/config.ts](mdc:lib/config.ts) and [lib/interface.ts](mdc:lib/interface.ts)

## Healthcare Component Type Patterns

- Use functional components with explicit TypeScript interfaces for healthcare props
- Define comprehensive prop interfaces immediately after imports:
  ```typescript
  interface PatientCardProps {
    patient: IPatientData;
    onAppointmentSchedule: (patientId: string) => Promise<void>;
    showSensitiveData?: boolean;
  }
  ```
- Use proper generic types for healthcare data operations
- Implement proper event handler types for medical forms (`React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>`)
- Use discriminated unions for healthcare status types
- Avoid React.FC type - prefer explicit return types for healthcare components

## Healthcare Data Validation & Error Handling

- **PRIORITY**: Replace all Yup usage in [lib/validation.ts](mdc:lib/validation.ts) with Zod
- Implement comprehensive Zod schemas for all healthcare data validation
- Use proper error types for medical data validation failures
- Implement proper error boundaries with healthcare-appropriate error types
- Use try-catch blocks with typed healthcare exceptions
- Implement proper validation for medical codes (ICD-10, CPT, NDC)
- Use branded types for validated healthcare data

## Healthcare Configuration & Environment Types

- Reference healthcare configurations from [lib/config.ts](mdc:lib/config.ts) with proper typing
- Use environment variables with proper TypeScript typing for healthcare settings
- Define interfaces for healthcare configuration objects (clinic info, appointment settings)
- Implement proper types for healthcare API responses and requests
- Use const assertions for healthcare configuration constants
- Implement proper typing for healthcare third-party integrations

## Healthcare API & Service Types

- Define comprehensive interfaces for all healthcare API endpoints
- Use proper request/response types for medical data operations
- Implement proper typing for healthcare authentication and authorization
- Use generic types for healthcare CRUD operations
- Implement proper error response types for healthcare API failures
- Reference service patterns from [services/](mdc:services/) directory with proper typing

## Healthcare Performance & Safety Types

- Use const assertions for healthcare configuration objects
- Implement proper types for healthcare performance monitoring
- Use proper typing for healthcare analytics and reporting
- Implement branded types for sensitive healthcare identifiers
- Use proper generic constraints for healthcare data processing
- Implement proper types for healthcare caching with PHI considerations

## Healthcare Documentation Standards

- Use comprehensive TSDoc comments for all healthcare APIs:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Schedules a new patient appointment with conflict checking
   * @param appointmentData - The appointment details to schedule
   * @param patientId - Unique patient identifier (branded type)
   * @returns Promise resolving to appointment confirmation
   * @throws {ValidationError} When appointment data is invalid
   * @throws {ConflictError} When appointment conflicts with existing schedule
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const appointment = await scheduleAppointment({
   *   patientId: 'PAT-12345' as PatientId,
   *   providerId: 'DOC-67890' as ProviderId,
   *   dateTime: new Date('2024-01-15T10:00:00Z')
   * });
   * ```
   */
  ```
- Document healthcare business rules and compliance requirements
- Use proper JSDoc tags for healthcare-specific metadata
- Document PHI handling and security considerations
