# React Component Architecture Guidelines

## Healthcare-First Component Organization

- Organize components by healthcare domain in [components/](mdc:components/) directory:
  - `components/client/appointments/` - Patient-facing appointment components
  - `components/dashboard/` - Healthcare provider dashboard components
  - `components/auth/` - Authentication and security components
  - `components/ui/` - Reusable UI components with healthcare design system
- Use index files for clean imports and follow the established patterns
- Separate client and server components appropriately for healthcare data sensitivity

## Component Structure & TypeScript Standards

- Use functional components with explicit TypeScript interfaces
- Define prop interfaces immediately after imports: `interface ComponentProps { ... }`
- Use PascalCase for component names, camelCase for props and functions
- Keep components single-purpose with clear healthcare domain responsibilities
- Use TSDoc comments for complex healthcare logic and APIs
- Follow the TypeScript patterns from [lib/interface.ts](mdc:lib/interface.ts)

## Healthcare State Management

- Use Zustand for global state as configured in [store/appointment/](mdc:store/appointment/)
- Use TanStack Query for server state management with healthcare data caching considerations
- Implement proper state persistence for patient data (with privacy considerations)
- Use React hooks for local component state (appointments, forms, UI states)
- Avoid prop drilling - use context for healthcare domain data sharing

## Form Handling & Medical Data Input

- **PRIORITY**: Replace all Yup usage in [lib/validation.ts](mdc:lib/validation.ts) with Zod
- Use Formik for complex medical forms (patient intake, prescription forms)
- Implement healthcare-specific validation (date formats, medical codes, dosage)
- Use controlled components for all medical data inputs
- Implement real-time validation with proper error messaging
- Add form auto-save for long medical forms to prevent data loss
- Use proper input masking for medical identifiers (SSN, insurance numbers)

## HeroUI Design System Integration

- Use HeroUI components from [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) theme configuration
- Follow the established color system (primary: healthcare green, secondary: neutral)
- Use consistent spacing from the defined layout system
- Implement proper dark/light mode support for healthcare environments
- Use the typography scale defined in the theme configuration
- Follow accessibility guidelines for healthcare applications

## Healthcare Data Display Components

- Use TanStack Table for patient lists, appointment schedules, medical records
- Implement proper loading states with healthcare-appropriate skeletons
- Use Recharts for medical data visualization (patient metrics, clinic analytics)
- Handle sensitive data display with proper privacy controls
- Implement proper empty states for healthcare scenarios
- Use data masking for sensitive information display

## Medical Domain Event Handling

- Use proper TypeScript event types: `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>`
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries for healthcare data operations
- Use async/await for medical data operations with proper error handling
- Provide clear user feedback for healthcare actions (appointments, prescriptions)
- Implement confirmation dialogs for critical medical actions
- Add audit logging for sensitive healthcare operations

## Performance & Healthcare Data Optimization

- Use React.memo for expensive medical data components
- Implement proper key props for patient/appointment lists
- Use useCallback and useMemo for expensive healthcare computations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large patient datasets
- Use lazy loading for medical images and documents
- Optimize re-renders for real-time healthcare data updates

## Healthcare Accessibility & Compliance

- Use semantic HTML elements for screen reader compatibility
- Implement ARIA attributes for complex medical forms
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all healthcare workflows
- Provide proper focus management for medical data entry
- Implement high contrast mode support for healthcare environments
- Use proper color contrast ratios for medical professionals
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common healthcare actions

## Healthcare Security in Components

- Never store sensitive medical data in component state without encryption
- Implement proper data sanitization before display
- Use secure data transmission for all medical data
- Implement session timeout handling for healthcare security
- Add data masking for sensitive information in development mode
- Use proper error boundaries to prevent data leakage
