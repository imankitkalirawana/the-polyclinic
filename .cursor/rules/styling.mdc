# Healthcare Styling & UI Design System Guidelines

## Healthcare Design System Foundation

- Use Tailwind CSS as the primary healthcare styling framework
- Follow the healthcare theme configuration in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
- Implement the healthcare design system with proper color psychology for medical environments
- Use HeroUI as the base component library with healthcare-specific customizations
- Reference theme provider patterns from [app/providers.tsx](mdc:app/providers.tsx)
- Support dark/light mode optimized for healthcare professionals and patient comfort

## Healthcare Color System & Accessibility

- **Primary Colors**: Use the defined healthcare green palette for trust and calm:
  - Light: `#1F6538` (primary-500) - Professional medical green
  - Dark: `#37a676` (primary-500) - Softer green for dark mode
- **Semantic Healthcare Colors**:
  - Success: `#1bc079` - Appointment confirmations, successful treatments
  - Warning: `#ffbd2e` - Medication alerts, cautionary information
  - Danger: `#f24821` - Critical alerts, emergency situations, contraindications
  - Secondary: `#000000` (light) / `#2D7147` (dark) - Supporting elements
- **Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** with minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for medical text
- Use high contrast mode support for healthcare professionals with visual impairments
- Implement color-blind friendly design patterns for medical data visualization

## Healthcare Typography System

- Use **Manrope font family** as configured for medical readability and professionalism
- Implement responsive typography scale appropriate for medical documents:
  - Tiny: `0.75rem/1rem` - Medical codes, reference numbers
  - Small: `0.875rem/1.25rem` - Form labels, secondary medical information
  - Medium: `1rem/1.5rem` - Body text, patient information
  - Large: `1.125rem/1.75rem` - Headers, important medical information
- Use proper heading hierarchy for medical document structure (h1-h6)
- Implement proper font weights for medical information hierarchy
- Ensure text remains readable at 200% zoom for accessibility compliance

## Healthcare Layout & Spacing Patterns

- Use the defined spacing scale for consistent healthcare UI:
  - Small radius: `0.75rem` - Form inputs, buttons
  - Medium radius: `1rem` - Cards, modals
  - Large radius: `1.5rem` - Major containers, panels
- Implement proper container widths for medical forms and data display:
  - Max-width: `8xl` (96rem) and `9xl` (105rem) for dashboard layouts
  - Responsive breakpoints including `xs: 512px` for mobile healthcare workers
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for complex healthcare dashboard layouts
- Implement proper whitespace for reducing cognitive load in medical interfaces

## Healthcare Component Styling Patterns

- **HeroUI Integration**: Use HeroUI components with healthcare theme customizations
- **Healthcare Buttons**: 
  - Primary actions: Emergency/critical medical actions
  - Secondary actions: Routine medical operations
  - Success actions: Confirmations and approvals
  - Warning actions: Cautionary medical decisions
  - Danger actions: Critical alerts and emergency responses
- **Medical Forms**: 
  - Use consistent form styling with proper validation states
  - Implement clear error messaging for medical data entry
  - Use proper input grouping for related medical information
  - Add visual indicators for required vs. optional medical fields
- **Healthcare Cards & Panels**:
  - Use consistent card designs for patient information, appointments, medical records
  - Implement proper elevation and shadows for visual hierarchy
  - Use border treatments for different types of medical information

## Healthcare Data Visualization Styling

- **Medical Data Tables**:
  - Use consistent table styling for patient lists, appointment schedules
  - Implement proper row highlighting for selected patients/appointments
  - Use color coding for appointment statuses, priority levels
  - Add proper sorting and filtering visual indicators
- **Medical Charts & Graphs**:
  - Use healthcare-appropriate color schemes for medical data
  - Implement proper legends and labeling for medical metrics
  - Use accessible patterns and textures in addition to colors
  - Ensure charts remain readable in both light and dark modes

## Healthcare Animation & Interaction Design

- **Framer Motion Integration**: Use for complex healthcare workflow animations
- **Tailwind Transitions**: Use for simple healthcare UI state changes
- **Healthcare Animation Guidelines**:
  - Subtle animations for patient data loading and updates
  - Clear transitions for appointment scheduling workflows
  - Smooth hover states for medical action buttons
  - Appropriate loading animations that don't cause anxiety
- **Custom Healthcare Animations**:
  - `caret-blink`: For form focus states in medical data entry
  - `marquee-horizontal/vertical`: For healthcare notifications and alerts
  - `card-up`: For medical information reveal animations

## Healthcare Responsive Design Patterns

- **Mobile-First Healthcare Design**: Optimize for healthcare workers using mobile devices
- **Breakpoint Strategy**:
  - Mobile: Healthcare workers on phones (emergency situations)
  - Tablet: Nurses and staff using tablets for patient care
  - Desktop: Administrative staff and doctors using workstations
  - Large screens: Multi-monitor healthcare professional setups
- **Touch-Friendly Design**: Ensure buttons and interactive elements are appropriately sized
- **Offline-Capable Styling**: Visual indicators for offline functionality in healthcare settings

## Healthcare Theme & Dark Mode Implementation

- **Healthcare Dark Mode**: Optimized for low-light healthcare environments (night shifts, dimmed patient rooms)
- **Theme Switching**: Seamless switching between light/dark modes for different healthcare scenarios
- **Context-Aware Theming**: Different themes for different healthcare areas (emergency, patient rooms, administrative)
- **Professional Mode**: High-contrast theme for healthcare professionals requiring clear visibility

## Healthcare Performance & Optimization

- **CSS Optimization**: Use Tailwind's purging for healthcare-specific components
- **Critical CSS**: Prioritize above-the-fold healthcare interface styles
- **Bundle Optimization**: Split healthcare styling by functional areas
- **Icon Optimization**: Use optimized medical icons and symbols
- **Image Optimization**: Proper handling of medical images and patient photos

## Healthcare Accessibility & Compliance Styling

- **HIPAA Visual Compliance**: Ensure styling doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper styling for screen reader navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Clear focus indicators for all interactive healthcare elements
- **High Contrast Support**: Additional styling for high contrast accessibility mode
- **Print Styles**: Proper styling for medical document printing
- **RTL Support**: Right-to-left language support for diverse patient populations

## Healthcare Brand Consistency

- Reference clinic information from [lib/config.ts](mdc:lib/config.ts) CLINIC_INFO
- Use consistent logo placement and sizing across healthcare interfaces
- Implement proper brand colors while maintaining medical professionalism
- Use consistent iconography that aligns with healthcare industry standards
- Maintain visual consistency across different healthcare functional areas
