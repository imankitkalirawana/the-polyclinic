# Comprehensive Healthcare Development Guidelines Summary

## Overview

This document provides a complete overview of development guidelines for The Polyclinic healthcare application, focusing on maintainability, scalability, HIPAA compliance, and patient safety.

## Critical Healthcare Priorities

### 1. Patient Health Information (PHI) Protection
- **NEVER** log, store, or transmit PHI without proper encryption
- Use field-level encryption for sensitive patient data
- Implement proper data masking in development and testing environments
- Reference healthcare domain guidelines in [healthcare-domain.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/healthcare-domain.mdc)

### 2. HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- Implement comprehensive audit trails for all PHI access
- Use role-based access controls with minimum necessary principle
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Maintain secure session management with appropriate timeouts
- Reference security patterns in [api.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/api.mdc)

### 3. Code Quality & Type Safety
- **CRITICAL**: Replace all Yup validation with Zod throughout the project
- Use strict TypeScript configuration from [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Follow healthcare-specific naming conventions from [typescript.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc)
- Implement comprehensive error handling with PHI protection

## Development Workflow Integration

### 1. Project Structure Adherence
- Follow healthcare domain organization from [project-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc)
- Organize components by healthcare functionality
- Use proper separation of concerns for medical data handling
- Reference [lib/config.ts](mdc:lib/config.ts) for healthcare configurations

### 2. Component Architecture
- Use healthcare-specific component patterns from [components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/components.mdc)
- Implement proper state management for patient data
- Use HeroUI design system with healthcare theme from [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
- Follow responsive design patterns for healthcare environments

### 3. API Development Standards
- Implement healthcare API patterns from [api.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/api.mdc)
- Use proper authentication from [lib/auth.ts](mdc:lib/auth.ts) and [lib/serverAuth.ts](mdc:lib/serverAuth.ts)
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Use proper error handling with HIPAA-compliant messaging

## Quality Assurance Integration

### 1. Testing Requirements
- Follow comprehensive testing guidelines from [testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing.mdc)
- Test all healthcare workflows and patient safety features
- Implement PHI protection in test data and scenarios
- Use synthetic healthcare data for testing

### 2. Code Review Process
- Use healthcare-specific review checklist from [git.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git.mdc)
- Verify HIPAA compliance in all code changes
- Check for PHI exposure in logs, errors, and client-side code
- Validate healthcare business logic and medical calculations

### 3. Monitoring & Error Tracking
- Implement Sentry monitoring with PHI protection from [sentry.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/sentry.mdc)
- Use structured logging with healthcare context
- Monitor healthcare-critical operations performance
- Implement proper incident response procedures

## Technology Stack Compliance

### 1. Next.js App Router Implementation
- Follow healthcare App Router patterns from [nextjs.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nextjs.mdc)
- Use proper Server vs Client component separation for PHI protection
- Implement healthcare-specific middleware and route protection
- Use proper data fetching patterns with privacy considerations

### 2. Styling & Design System
- Use healthcare design system from [styling.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/styling.mdc)
- Implement accessibility features for healthcare environments
- Use proper color psychology and contrast for medical interfaces
- Support healthcare professional workflows across devices

### 3. TypeScript Implementation
- Follow strict TypeScript guidelines from [typescript.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc)
- Use healthcare domain type definitions
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use branded types for sensitive healthcare identifiers

## Continuous Integration Requirements

### 1. Pre-commit Quality Gates
- Run healthcare-specific linting and formatting
- Perform security vulnerability scanning
- Execute PHI detection and masking verification
- Validate TypeScript compilation and type safety

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- Comprehensive healthcare testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Security scanning and compliance verification
- Performance testing for healthcare workflows
- Automated backup and rollback procedures

### 3. Deployment Procedures
- Healthcare-specific deployment checklist
- Database migration verification
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Emergency rollback procedures
